class UnchunkedGenerator:
    """
    Non-batched data generator, used for testing.
    Sequences are returned one at a time (i.e. batch size = 1), without chunking.

    If data augmentation is enabled, the batches contain two sequences (i.e. batch size = 2),
    the second of which is a mirrored version of the first.

    Arguments:
    cameras -- list of cameras, one element for each video (optional, used for semi-supervised training)
    poses_3d -- list of ground-truth 3D poses, one element for each video (optional, used for supervised training)
    poses_2d -- list of input 2D keypoints, one element for each video
    pad -- 2D input padding to compensate for valid convolutions, per side (depends on the receptive field)
    causal_shift -- asymmetric padding offset when causal convolutions are used (usually 0 or "pad")
    augment -- augment the dataset by flipping poses horizontally
    kps_left and kps_right -- list of left/right 2D keypoints if flipping is enabled
    joints_left and joints_right -- list of left/right 3D joints if flipping is enabled
