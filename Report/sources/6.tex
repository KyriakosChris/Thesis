To summarize, in this thesis, we developed an algorithm that can estimate the 3D human pose from a video using some well-known pre-trained deep neural networks. As a result, we converted these 3D coordinates into a BVH file with a humanoid with 17 bones. Furthermore, we developed a tool that will be useful to all animators who will use our algorithm. This tool can be used to remove noise from BVH files using signal processing filters, manually fix the location of the humanoid in space, and display the results. Finally, we converted all the algorithms from raw python code to a Windows Application with the Tkinter Library.
