Despite the shortcomings of our approach, there are numerous disciplines worth investigating:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Import Facial and hand models: } As we mentioned before, our model contains only 17 bones, if someone could create a model that can estimate facial and hand points with great accuracy, it would be a massive enhancement for our Application.
  \item \textbf{Import computerized motion clips into Robots: } The algorithm runs in our system runs at 4-5 frames per second in an above-average system. If we use a better system, it could run in Real-Time. This means that someone could use a Robot, that contains a camera, that would find a human and would try to copy his motion in Real-Time.
  \item \textbf{Improve the current Neural Network models: } In our approach, we used two pre-trained models in order to estimate the 3D human-Pose from a video. These models can be improved with further training or with an enhancement to their architecture. However, this improvement progress is very slow, since there is not any proven mathematical way that can evaluate each possible architecture.
