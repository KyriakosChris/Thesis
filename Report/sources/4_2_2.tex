Unfortunately, the method of the skeleton position estimation, in some cases may do not satisfy the animators. Therefore, the purpose of this tool is to allow the animator to make some adjustments of his preference in the motion root of the skeleton. More specifically, the animator will input three float numbers one for each dimension, that will multiply for the correspond position of the hip for each frame of the motion data. This will amplify the motion root speed if the float number is above one , otherwise it will decreased it. One last note is that the Skeleton initial height is in the ground, therefore we do not recommend to amplify the Y dimension of the Skeleton, since the Skeleton will float into the 3D space.
