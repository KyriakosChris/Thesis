First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Aikaterini Mania for her guidance and her fast response as well as her willingness to support me during my thesis. I am also grateful to Giariskanis Fotios as well as all the surreal team for their support and ideas since without them the implementation would be poorer. \\

Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Chalkiadakis Georgios and Prof. Michail G. Lagoudakis for their time and support to the thesis committee. I also wanted to thank Prof. Apostolos Dollas, Prof. Michalis Zervakis, and Prof. Athanasios Liavas for their advice and recommendations during my graduate applications. \\

Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends, and my colleague for the support that they gave me during my thesis.
