In this Chapter, we will evaluate the performance of the two pre-trained Neural Networks as well as the filters that we used. In order to evaluate the models, we will use some well-known metric systems that were developed by some researchers for this exact purpose. More specifically, we will find the average error in millimeters that each model does during the estimation. In order to evaluate the models, we need to have the estimated data from the neural networks as well as the correct data for the same input, which we will compare to find the error. Luckily for us, these models that we are using have already been evaluated by many researchers, so will just present the graphs for the input as well as the metric system that they used in order to evaluate the models. Regarding the filters, we will just compare the best scenario performance of each one of them when they try to filter the same motion data, and we will display the results.
