In this thesis, we developed an algorithm based on some well-known pre-trained deep neural networks, that can estimate the 3D human pose from a video. Therefore, we converted these 3D coordinates into a BVH file, that contains a humanoid with 17 bones. In addition, we created a tool that is useful to all the animators who will use our algorithm. This tool can be used to clear the noise of the BVH files with some signal processing filters, to manually fix the location of the humanoid in the space, and to display the results. Finally, we retarget the animation to an avatar that we found online, to show that the animators can use this animation for any other character of their preference. \\

Both the algorithm and the tool were implemented in python. However, this thesis is addressed to animators, and many animators do not have good enough python knowledge to run the code. Therefore, with the help of the Tinker python library, we converter the raw Python Code into a Windows Application that has a very friendly user environment. Even though that with the raw python code, animators can adjust the code to solve their problems, the windows application that we created, in general, can help them solve many things that may need.
