In the previous chapters, we discussed about our algorithms and the tools that we offer to the animators. However, the environment that someone has to use in order to run these algorithms is not very friendly to the users. If someone does not have excellent knowledge of python and at least the basic knowledge of Neural Networks, then may struggle to run the raw python code.\\

Therefore, we converted the raw python code into a Windows Application that run all the aspects of the code. Firstly, the User will convert the real Video with a Human motion that meets our requirements into a BVH file, and afterwards he will use our tool to visualize, clean and edit the motion data that our algorithms estimated. \\

Notice that these BVH files can be only imported to 3D computer graphics software tool sets (Maya, Blender, Motion Builder, etc.). If the user wants to import them into a Game Engine (Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.) he must convert this file into an FBX file. An FBX (.FBX) file is a format used to exchange 3D geometry and animation data. All the 3D computer graphics software tool-sets which we mentioned, can easily and fast convert every BVH file into an FBX.
