In this section, we will propose some tools for the animators that will help them process and edit further the BVH file that we created. We created three tools for the animators. The first allows the user to amplify each dimension of the position speed for all the frames. In the second tool, we used some digital and Gaussian distribution filters in order to smooth out the BVH motion data that the neural networks estimated from the video, which help to reduce the noise between each frame. Finally, we created a tool that converts the bvh motion data into a mp4 video. More specifically, we created a 3D space, and we import each joint of the motion as a point for each frame. We will discuss later in this section more thoroughly about this visualization method.
